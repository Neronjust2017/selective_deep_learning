# Selective Classification for Deep Neural Networks
By Yonatan Geifman and Ran El-Yaniv

### Introduction:
This repository contains the implementation of  VGG-16 models for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and the risk bound proposed in the paper ["Selective Classification for Deep Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08500).
